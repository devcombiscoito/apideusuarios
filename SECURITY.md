# Security Policy

Nothing will happen here, besides there already being nothing.

## Supported Versions

For now, I'm not releasing security updates, but when I start,
these versions will be compatible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
